if you want to update these libraries:

1. Update Git submodules
2. cd gir && cargo install --path .
3. get GIRs of our libraries, currently libhelium, libbismuth, and fusebox (for vala based libs, make sure it's the gir generated by valadoc); there's also a meson project to help with this
4. move them into this dir
5. manually patch the GIRs to make them work (will make an automatic patch system later lol)
6. ./generator.py (go back to 3 until it works)
7. now, it's time to see if we need to generate any new methods, go into each library folder and run `gir -o . -m not_bound` (no, you don't need to do this in sys crates)
8. based on the output from 7, update the generate array in each library's gir.toml, see https://gtk-rs.org/gir/book/tutorial/high_level_rust_api.html#generating-the-code
9. ./generator.py
10. Test your changes, `cargo build`
11. profit?

(I will make this better soon)

if step 9 fails, it may mean:

1. you put something that shouldn't be generated into `generate`
2. you may need to update `manual`, this is used for referenced classes from other libs
3. you may need to write manual bindings or overrides, see files that are not auto/
